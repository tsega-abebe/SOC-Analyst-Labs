# SOC Analyst Labs & Projects

This repository contains my hands-on SOC Analyst practice (TryHackMe/Splunk) and three showcase projects.
It is designed to be recruiter- and ATS-friendly and demonstrates skills in SIEM, threat detection, and secure engineering.

## Structure
- **Day1/** and **Day2/** — lab notes, searches (SPL), and findings.
- **SplunkQueries/** — reusable SPL queries.
- **Projects/** — three portfolio projects (Network Scanner, Image Steganography, Web Biometric Auth).
