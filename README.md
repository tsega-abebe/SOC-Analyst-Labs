# SOC Analyst Labs & Projects

This repository contains my hands-on SOC Analyst practice (TryHackMe/Splunk) and three showcase projects.
It is designed to be recruiter- and ATS-friendly and demonstrates skills in SIEM, threat detection, and secure engineering.

## Structure
- **Day1/** and **Day2/** — lab notes, searches (SPL), and findings.
- **SplunkQueries/** — reusable SPL queries.
- **Projects/** — three portfolio projects (Network Scanner, Image Steganography, Web Biometric Auth).

## How to Reproduce
- Import `SplunkQueries/vpn_logs_queries.spl` into Splunk's Search & Reporting.
- Replace placeholders in project READMEs and run the examples.
- Export tables from Splunk as CSV and place them in the corresponding Day folders if screenshots are unavailable.

## Skills Highlighted
SIEM (Splunk), Incident Response, Threat Detection, Log Analysis, TCP/IP, Python, Linux, Cryptography, IAM, Web Security.
